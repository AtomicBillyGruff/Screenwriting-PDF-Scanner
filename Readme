Scanner 1 is an older version of Scanner 2. Scanner 2 just uses a method after it breaks down a wordlist that contains lines with more than one word per line.

like this:
word list


breaks down that list if its more than one word that way you dont have to make sure everything perfect

like: 

word
list

----------------

outputs to the outputs folder after youve renamed it. 

I like to use Pycharm as the IDE to run the script. I'll run one and change the paths and the files to have 3 wordlists iterating over the PDF's at a time. 

-------------Reorder--------------

Reorder is a tool that goes through the output text file, splices it, turns numbers back into integers and creates a pandas csv file that way you can easily see everything 
you've highlighted in ascending page order. That way you aren't tied down to searching all across the pdf by word -- you can also do by page.
